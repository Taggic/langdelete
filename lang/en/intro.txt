====== Delete languages ======
=== Quick Help: ===

On this page you can delete all language files and folders of your DokuWiki to reduce the space consumption on your web host. \\ 
Simply define the language you want to keep. English as fundamental requirement will be kept also. All other language files and \\  
folders of inc and lib directory will be deleted. Reading the [[doku>plugin:langdelete|plugin description]] might help your understanding of the functionality \\ 
and delivering update information. 

Developers of DokuWiki are asked to use ISO 639-1 two-letter codes for language abbreviation. Two-letter codes can be retrieved \\ 
from [[wp>List_of_ISO_639-1_codes]] or from [[http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php|US Library of Congress]].
