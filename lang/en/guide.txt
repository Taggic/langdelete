Languages are represented by their ISO 639-1 two-letter codes. For example German is ''de'' and French is ''fr''.\\
The full list is available on Wikipedia at [[wp>List_of_ISO_639-1_codes]] or from the [[http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php|US Library of Congress]].

To keep multiple languages, separate them with commas like this: ''en,fr,de''.
